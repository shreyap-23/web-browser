console.log(); ---- to print  
.name ----------dot syntax  
["age"]---box syntax

only in VAR we can re declare the value but not in LET , CONST  
 var name=shreya  
 var name = shre

reassign of value is only allowed in var,let
var name=shreya  
name=shre --similar with let
push adds val at the end of the array

**hi**------bold
re creating of a variable -- redeclare  
 assigning new val to the varialbe --- reassign

 >camleCase--- rules to write down the variables ie highRatedBooks()

> SCOPE:
> LIFE TIME OF A VARIABLE

let variable cant be worked outside of the block {}
var can be accessed out of the block since it has lifetime

undefine is the value (wen we wont assign a val we get that its )
not defined is the error

declare func --- function fun(){code }  
func cant work out of the block

parseInt converts to num------ console.log(x1 + parseInt(x2));  
console.log(x1 + +x2);

null+5-----------o/p is 5 null is converted to 0  
[]+[]----------''  
4 \* "5a"--------Nan (wen it cant be converted to nu it showa notanumb)  
==------compare (check for the value) converstion occurs  
===------(checks directly no convertion)
=== works faster than ==

#types of functions  
normal function  
arrow function

function can be exit 2 way that is by calling return and

> arrow function  
>  const double =(n)=>n\*2; // can be declare wen its in single line

#why to use functions?  
DRY--DONT REPEAT YOURSELF is a thumb rule.  
no repeations,reuseability,error identify,readability ,modular---divide into chunks  
code quality:5 pillars ---

- readability-75% 
- maintainability-code dept
- extensibility
- testability
- performance

copy by reference -------- copy of adress  
copy of value ------[....x1]; spread on values  

different types of FOR LOOPS:  
 - for loop
- for in 
- for of
